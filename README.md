# This project is to count heatwave days and frequency by collection daily temperature data from NOAA from 2000 to 2020
## Heatwave definition: The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) defines a heat wave as a period during which the daily 
## maximum temperature exceeds for more than five consecutive days the maximum normal temperature by 9 degrees Fahrenheit 
## (5 degrees Celsius), the normal period being defined as 1961â€“1990.

## Steps to find out the heatwave frequency and days:
### Step 1. Collect the max temperature data during 1961 to 1990 from NOAA:

### Step 2. Assign the max temp data to the nearest county:
### Step 3. Find the average max temperature during 1961 to 1990:
### Step 4. Collect the daily temperature data from NOAA from 2000 to 2020
### Step 4. Based on the max temperature during 1961 to 1990, count one heatwave if there are at least 5 consecutive days in each year for each county: 
### Step 5. Find the heatwave days if the daily max temperature is over the average max temperature during 1961 to 1990:
